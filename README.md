# Storage-Manager

This is an App where you can manage your self-storage.

Users can: 
    (1) add/remove a place for storage (eg., a bookshelf or a wardrobe).
    (2) set the capacity for some storage space (eg., a bookshelf can only store up to 10 items). When exceeding the capacity, there will be notifications.
    (3) add/remove an item to/from some storage space (eg., add/remove a book from the bookshelf).
    (4) replace the item from one storage space to another (eg., move a book from the wardrobe to the bookshelf).
    (5) set some limit of some items (eg., some fresh food might be only stored for up to 5 days).
    (6) view all the items stored at a certain place or all the items in the storage right now.
